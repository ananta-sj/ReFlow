**ReFlow Studio** is a powerhouse desktop suite designed to make global content accessible and family-friendly. By combining state-of-the-art Speech-to-Text, Neural TTS, and Computer Vision, ReFlow allows you to dub and censor videos entirely on your own hardware.

## 💡 Why ReFlow?
Most AI tools require expensive cloud subscriptions and compromise your privacy. ReFlow is different:
* **100% Private:** No video or audio ever leaves your computer.
* **Hinglish Optimized:** Built specifically to handle the linguistic nuances of the Indian market.
* **All-in-One:** Don't use three different tools; dub, translate, and censor in one single pipeline.

**✨ New in v0.3.1:** Integrated **Settings Manager**. The app now remembers your custom themes, language preferences, and hardware configurations automatically.

## ✨ Core Modules

### 🎙️ AI Dubbing Engine
* **Neural Transcription:** Powered by **OpenAI Whisper** for near-perfect accuracy even in noisy environments.
* **Voice Cloning (XTTS v2):** Generates natural, emotive speech that matches the original speaker's tone.
* **Docu-Mix Technology:** Professional-grade audio ducking—keep the original background track while the AI voice takes the lead.

### 🛡️ Smart Safety Suite
* **Visual Shield (NudeNet):** Real-time frame analysis to identify and blur NSFW content or gore with surgical precision.
* **Dynamic Audio Bleeping:** Automatically detects and replaces profanity with a beep or silence based on the transcript.
